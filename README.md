# BlogApp
It is a REST API based backend blogging application in Spring Boot. The objective of the project is to implement a blog web-based application where the users will post useful and informative blogs.                                                                                        
● There are two modules in this application which are Admin user & Normal user & to authenticate user, JWT Authentication is used.  
● To test the functionalities I have used JUnit testing & for API documentation Swagger UI.
